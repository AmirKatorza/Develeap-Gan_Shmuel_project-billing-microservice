# Gan Shmuel project API specification

## Weight Microservice
The industrial weight is in charge of weighing trucks, allowing payment to providers.
The WeightApp tracks all weights and allows payment to be for net weight.

> Reminder: `Bruto = Neto (fruit) + Tara (truck) + sum(Tara (containers))`

### Weight API routes
POST /weight
- direction=in/out/none (none could be used, for example, when weighing a standalone container)
- truck=<license> (If weighing a truck. Otherwise "na")
- containers=str1,str2,... comma delimited list of container ids
- weight=<int>
- unit=kg/lbs {precision is ~5kg, so dropping decimal is a non-issue}
- force=true/false { see logic below }
- produce=<str> {id of produce, e.g. "orange", "tomato", ... OR "na" if empty}
Records data and server date-time and returns a json object with a unique weight.
Note that "in" & "none" will generate a new session id, and "out" will return session id of previous "in" for the truck.
"in" followed by "in" OR "out" followed by "out":
- if force=false will generate an error
- if force=true will over-write previous weigh of same truck
"out" without an "in" will generate error
"none" after "in" will generate error
Return value on success is:
{ "id": <str>,
  "truck": <license> or "na",
  "bruto": <int>,
  ONLY for OUT:
  "truckTara": <int>,
  "neto": <int> or "na" // na if some of containers have unknown tara
}

POST /batch-weight
- file=<filename>
Will upload list of tara weights from a file in "/in" folder. Usually used to accept a batch of new containers. 
File formats accepted: csv (id,kg), csv (id,lbs), json ([{"id":..,"weight":..,"unit":..},...])

GET /unknown
Returns a list of all recorded containers that have unknown weight:
["id1","id2",...]

GET /weight?from=t1&to=t2&filter=f
- t1,t2 - date-time stamps, formatted as yyyymmddhhmmss. server time is assumed.
- f - comma delimited list of directions. default is "in,out,none"
default t1 is "today at 000000". default t2 is "now".
returns an array of json objects, one per weighing (batch NOT included):
[{ "id": <id>,
  "direction": in/out/none,
  "bruto": <int>, //in kg
  "neto": <int> or "na" // na if some of containers have unknown tara
  "produce": <str>,
  "containers": [ id1, id2, ...]
},...]


GET /item/<id>?from=t1&to=t2
- id is for an item (truck or container). 404 will be returned if non-existent
- t1,t2 - date-time stamps, formatted as yyyymmddhhmmss. server time is assumed.
default t1 is "1st of month at 000000". default t2 is "now".
Returns a json:
{ "id": <str>,
  "tara": <int> OR "na", // for a truck this is the "last known tara"
  "sessions": [ <id1>,...]
}

GET /session/<id>
- id is for a weighing session. 404 will be returned if non-existent
Returns a json:
{ "id": <str>,
  "truck": <truck-id> or "na",
  "bruto": <int>,
  ONLY for OUT:
  "truckTara": <int>,
  "neto": <int> or "na" // na if some of containers unknown
}

GET /health
- By default returns "OK" and status 200 OK
- If system depends on external resources (e.g. db), and they are not available (e.g. "select 1;" fails ) then it should return "Failure" and 500 Internal Server Error


## Billing Microservice
The payment application is used to calculate pay for fruit providers.

### Billing API routes
POST /provider
creates a new provider record:
- name - provider name. must be unique.
Returns a unique provider id as json: { "id":<str>}

PUT /provider/{id} can be used to update provider name

POST /rates
- file=<filename>
Will upload new rates from an excel file in "/in" folder. Rate excel has the following columns:
- Product - a product id
- Rate - integer (in agorot)
- Scope - ALL or A provider id.
The new rates over-write the old ones
A scoped rate has higher precedence than an "ALL" rate

GET /rates
Will download a copy of the same excel that was uploaded using POST /rates

POST /truck
registers a truck in the system
- provider - known provider id
- id - the truck license plate

PUT /truck/{id} can be used to update provider id

GET /truck/<id>?from=t1&to=t2
- id is the truck license. 404 will be returned if non-existent
- t1,t2 - date-time stamps, formatted as yyyymmddhhmmss. server time is assumed.
default t1 is "1st of month at 000000". default t2 is "now".
Returns a json:
{ "id": <str>,
  "tara": <int>, // last known tara in kg
  "sessions": [ <id1>,...]
}

GET /bill/<id>?from=t1&to=t2
- id is provider id
- t1,t2 - date-time stamps, formatted as yyyymmddhhmmss. server time is assumed.
default t1 is "1st of month at 000000". default t2 is "now". 
Returns a json:
{
  "id": <str>,
  "name": <str>,
  "from": <str>,
  "to": <str>,
  "truckCount": <int>,
  "sessionCount": <int>,
  "products": [
    { "product":<str>,
      "count": <str>, // number of sessions
      "amount": <int>, // total kg
      "rate": <int>, // agorot
      "pay": <int> // agorot
    },
    ...
    ...
    ...
  ],
  "total": <int> // agorot
}

GET /health
 - By default returns "OK" and status 200 OK
 - If system depends on external resources (e.g. db), and they are not available (e.g. "select 1;" fails ) then it should return "Failure" and 500 Internal Server Error
 - Failure of "weight" system is not relevant, i.e. payment system is OK even if weight system is not


## DevOps CI Service
Teams should *only* use the tools we have learned so far in the bootcamp (i.e. not GitHub actions, etc.).
The DevOps service should await a trigger, and then activate the CI workflow (clone, build, test, deploy...).

### DevOps API routes
GET /health
- By default returns "OK" and status 200 OK

POST /trigger
The request body contains useful JSON data from GitHub such as:
- "action" - The action performed. Can be `created`, `edited`, or `deleted`.
- "pusher" - The user that triggered the event.
- "repository.branches_url" - For getting which branch the action took place on.
